### About Me

I am a recent computer science graduate with a strong focus on full-stack web development, AI, and backend technologies. I’ve gained practical experience building web applications, handling both front-end and back-end tasks. I'm constantly exploring new technologies and looking for opportunities to grow as a developer.

### About This Site

This portfolio showcases my skills and projects in full-stack engineering. It’s built with NextJS for server-side rendering and SEO, Flask for backend integration, and features AI via GPT API. The site is deployed using Azure DevOps with Docker, ensuring a seamless CI/CD pipeline. Feel free to explore my work!
