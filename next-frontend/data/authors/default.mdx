# About Me

I am a recent computer science graduate with a strong background in full-stack web development, AI, and other backend development areas. Over the past two years, I have gained valuable work experience building web applications and handling both front-end and back-end tasks. Throughout my studies and personal projects, I have developed a solid understanding of various technologies and am committed to maintaining and improving my skills by exploring new technologies and tackling challenging projects.

I am currently seeking new opportunities where I can apply my skills and continue to grow as a developer. If you're looking for a dedicated and skilled developer, I would be interested in discussing potential roles.

# About This Site

Welcome to my personal portfolio site! This platform is a showcase of my skills and projects, built to demonstrate my expertise in web development and full-stack engineering.

## Technologies Used:

### NextJS

The site is built using NextJS, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, ensuring fast load times and excellent SEO performance.

### SEO

Iâ€™ve implemented SEO best practices throughout the site to improve visibility and search engine ranking, making sure my work gets the attention it deserves.

### Full-Stack Integration

The site features seamless full-stack integration, utilizing a Flask backend to handle server-side logic and API communication. Frontend utilizes React-Typescript & Tailwind CSS.
Docker is used for the containerization of the frontend (next) and backend (flask) services.

### GPT API

The backend communicates with a GPT API, showcasing my skills in AI and backend development by integrating advanced language models into the site.

### Azure DevOps

The entire project is deployed on Azure using their DevOps platform, ensuring a robust CI/CD pipeline and reliable deployment processes.
