Hey there! I'm a full-stack web app engineer with a wealth of experience, particularly in Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and Next.js. My expertise spans both backend and frontend development, enabling me to create robust and scalable web applications.

I thrive in dynamic and fast-paced environments where every day brings something new. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, sharing ideas, and finding the best ways to deliver high-quality software solutions.

My focus is on creating seamless, efficient, and user-friendly applications that make a real difference. While I'm always keen to stay updated with the latest tech trends, I also value thoughtful planning and strategic execution.

In my downtime, I like exploring new technologies and working on personal projects to keep my skills sharp. Letâ€™s connect and see how we can build something amazing together!
